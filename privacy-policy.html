You may request a refund by sending a written Refund Request. Upon timely receipt of the request, Devtech will refund the total payment made by you, less a service and processing fee of 20% on package amount for a logo package whereas in case of a website, if the website is in the development phase the 40% design cost will be deducted from the package amount processed for refund.</p>

Also if the client is non-responsive for more than 60 Days then the client has to pay an extra caution fee i.e. $150 for re-initiating the project.</p>

            <p>In case if the client wants to forfeit the website portion of the package after 30 days, refund won't be applicable; though we can hold the project in such case and the client can come later and get the project started again.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the customer shall forfeit the right to the refund outlined above if customer request additional revisions (1 or more design changes regardless of the complexity) or modifications to any of the initial concepts.
